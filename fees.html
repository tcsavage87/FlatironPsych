    <h1>Fees</h1>
    <p>If you do not have any mental health benefits as part of your insurance coverage, our psychologists will discuss their fees with you when scheduling your initial appointment. We offer a sliding scale fee structure and accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards. Many insurance companies offer out-of-network benefits. Please contact your insurance provider to determine if you are eligible to receive reimbursement for our services.</p>
    <p>We are currently in-network providers for United Health Care and several other insurance plans. Be sure to mention it to our staff so they can assist you in obtaining the necessary pre-authorizations prior to the commencement of treatment.</p>
