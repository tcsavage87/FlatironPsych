    <h1>Problems Treated</h1>
    <p>C.B.T. has been extensively validated in research as the best method for dealing with many problems including: </p>
    <div id="accordion">
      <h4 class="accordion-toggle">Anxiety</h4>
      <div class="accordion-content">    
        <p>There are many sources of anxiety that people deal with on a day to day basis. At times pressures from work, relationships or family can be overwhelming. Many people lack effective coping mechanisms. Dealing with the stressors effectively depends on addressing the sources of anxiety which can be either physiological, cognitive, or both.</p>
        <p>Physiological components of anxiety often manifest as physical symptoms including increased heart rate, shortness of breath, sweating, clenching of the teeth, and even shaking in the limbs. Treatment of these involves relaxation training through the use of biofeedback or neurotraining, both of which have been found to have a significant positive impact.</p>
        <p>Cognitive components frequently center around obsessive, racing thoughts that are often very difficult to let go. Studies consistently show that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in the treatment of the irrational thoughts that many people deal with on a daily basis. Simply put, it is necessary to dispute the irrational fears that we hold as truth.</p>
        <p>The staff at Flatiron Psych Group has extensive experience in dealing with both components of anxiety in a solution-focused way.

    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">Obsessive Thinking</h4>
    <div class="accordion-content"> 

      <p>"What if ...?" is the classic question that many people with obsessive thinking deal with on a daily basis. Many people obsess about careers, relationships, or things that they encounter on a day to day basis. Not everyone has the capacity to get rid of these thoughts and they can take over a person's life.</p>
      <p>The classic forms of obsessive thinking center around checking, contamination and hoarding. Examples of thoughts that these individuals have respectively include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"What if I didn't turn of the stove?"</li>
        <li>"What if the fork is dirty?"</li>
        <li>"What if I need this later?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other forms of obsessive thinking are also quite common. They can range from sexual concerns to work to relationships. These thoughts often lead to compulsive behaviors that can be quite debilitating.</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that the treatment that is most effect for obsessive thinking is a cognitive-behavioral technique called exposure with response prevention. Relaxation training is taught and the individual learns to confront fears without engaging in rituals that have previously been used to decrease anxiety.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content"> 

      <p>When a person engages in behavior that seems irrational to themselves but they feel that they must do it, they are engaging in compulsive behavior. Many people have quirks or eccentricities that seem harmless. When it gets to the point that the individual no longer feels any control over their behavior, it may be necessary to seek professional intervention.</p>
      <p>There area a multitude of classic compulsive behaviors but generally speaking they fall into three categories which are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaning (e.g. hand washing)</li>
        <li>Checking (e.g. making sure the stove is turned off repeatedly)</li>
        <li>Hoarding (e.g. holding on to newspapers just in case you want to refer back to an article)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Studies consistently show that the best form of treatment for dealing with compulsive behavior is a cognitive behavioral technique known as exposure with response prevention.</p>

    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">Problematic Relationships</h4>
    <div class="accordion-content"> 

      <p>Ups and downs are a normal part of any relationship. For the most part, people are able to resolve issues on their own but sometimes problems escalate that require the help of a professional.</p>
      <p>Many of the problems in a relationship are the result of poor communication and a lack of compromise between partners. Couples who experience a great deal of conflict are not listening to one another's needs and desires or they are unable to hear the other person's point of view. In addition, there's a lack of flexibility in accommodating what the other person wants to do.</p>
      <p>Cognitive-Behavioral therapy has been found to be an effective treatment for couples who are experiencing conflict in their relationship. A qualified therapist can provide people with the tools so that they are able to resolve the conflicts that they experience in their day to day living. Specifically, relaxation training and reframing of events are important tools that many people simply do not incorporate into their relationships.</p>

    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">Sexual Dysfunction</h4>
    <div class="accordion-content"> 

      <p>Difficulties of a sexual nature are common from time to time. When they occur with regularity, they can have a significant impact on a relationship. Avoidance due to fear of failure can leave partners feeling that something important is missing. Regardless of whether you are a man or a woman, sexual dysfunction is partly the result of anxiety.</p>
      <p>In men, there are two basic types of sexual problems: erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. The former is characterized by an inability to attain or the loss of an erection when engaged in sexual activity. The latter results in orgasm either prior to penetration or soon after.</p>
      <p>Women suffer from vaginismus. This is an involuntary tightening of the vaginal walls prior to sexual activity such that penetration is impossible. It is important to note that this muscle tightening does not occur in other situations.</p>
      <p>Treatment begins with first ruling out medical causes for the problem. Although medications are available for some of these problems, often they are not enough. Specific treatment strategies using relaxation training and other techniques such as sensate focus have been developed. Although people are often treated individually, partners should be included as well in order to maximize the chances for success.</p>
      <p>The psychologists working at Flatiron Psych Group have worked with all types of sexual dysfunction. We have the experience to work with you so you are able to see results soon. Don't wait another day, e-mail us now to set up an appointment. You'll be glad you took this step towards having healthier more fulfilling sexual relationships.</p>

    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">Anger Management</h4>
        <div class="accordion-content"> 

    <p>We all get angry at one time or another for a variety of reasons. However, there is a great deal of variability in terms of level of anger and duration. People who get angry very quickly and intensely for an extended period of time, may need help in developing strategies to deal with this problem.</p>
    <p>Anger, like anxiety, has both cognitive and physiological components. Cognitive components seem to focus around thoughts of being slighted in an intentional manner or your rights being disregarded. In terms of physiology, we have a very standard set of responses that our body goes through when we are becoming angry.</p>
    <p>The management of anger addresses both of the components mentioned above. Cognitive reframing and examination of self statements are necessary to deal with the thoughts that lead to the experience of anger. Biofeedback can also be used in order to deal with the physiology that the body presents.</p>
    <p>At Flatiron Psych Group we have extensive experience in dealing with the both the cognitive components and relaxation training that are necessary for effective management of people's anger. Don't wait another day, e-mail us now to set up an appointment. You'll be glad you took this step towards leading a happier life where your anger is under control.</p>
