    <h1>Psychological Testing</h1>
    <p>Assessment by a qualified psychologist is necessary at times to quantify a person's level of functioning. Based upon the results, specific recommendation can be made that are tailored to fit the individual. The questions which psychologists are asked to answer vary widely:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intelligence Testing</strong> is conducted in order to determine an individual's level of cognitive functioning. During this process a person's strengths and weaknesses are determined which can be of assistance in determining which methods of learning are most suited to the individual.</li>
      <li><strong>Achievement Testing</strong>focuses on an person's general fund of knowledge. Often times this is necessary in order to determine appropriate placement for the individual being assessed.</li>
      <li><strong>Neuropsychological evaluation</strong> involves examination of a individual's cognitive processes or thinking style. Frequently this is done when people have suffered some event that has limited their cognitive ability such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury.</li>
      <li><strong>Personality Assessment</strong> is the examination of people's emotional functioning and those factors that impact their day to day life in this area. This can be useful for treatment purposes so that therapists can further focus on the presenting problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Forensic evaluation</strong> is done for legal purposes in order to determine a person's current level of emotional pain & suffering, their true cognitive and emotional capacities, and their judgment.</li>
    </ul>
